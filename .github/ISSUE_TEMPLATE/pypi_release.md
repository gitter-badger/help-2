# PyPI Release
Please read the information about [releases](https://jazzband.co/about/releases) on the website before submitting an issue. In particular, if a project already has project leads assigned, then you'd be better of creating an issue in the individual project, and asking the leads to do a release.

In the event there are no project leads, you're in the right place! Please link the project for which you'd like to create a release.
